# K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
The K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm is a versatile and intuitive machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It operates based on the idea that data points with similar features tend to have similar labels. In K-NN, "K" represents the number of nearest neighbors to consider when making a prediction. This algorithm is non-parametric, which means it doesn't make strong assumptions about the underlying data distribution.

In this repository, we provide a Python implementation of the K-NN algorithm. This implementation is well-documented and serves as a valuable resource for understanding the algorithm, its implementation, and its applications in various machine learning tasks.

## k-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) Implementation
This repository contains a Python implementation of the K-NN algorithm, covering both classification and regression aspects. You can find the following components within this implementation:

- **Classification**: K-NN for classification tasks, where the algorithm assigns a class label based on the majority class among the k-nearest neighbors.

- **Regression**: K-NN for regression tasks, where the algorithm predicts a continuous value based on the average or weighted average of the k-nearest neighbors' target values.

- **Distance Metrics**: Various distance metrics, such as Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance, to measure the similarity between data points.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Techniques for selecting the optimal value of "K" and other hyperparameters.
