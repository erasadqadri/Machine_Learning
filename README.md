# Machine Learning
Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that allow computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It is a rapidly evolving field with applications across various industries, including healthcare, finance, robotics, and many more.

This repository contains a collection of Python implementations of popular machine learning algorithms. These algorithms can be used for tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, and more.
